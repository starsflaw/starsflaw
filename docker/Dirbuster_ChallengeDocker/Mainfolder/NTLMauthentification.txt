Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is a challenge-response authentication protocol used to authenticate a client to a resource 
on an Active Directory domain. When the client requests access to a service associated with the domain, the service sends
 a challenge to the client, requiring that the client to perform a mathematical operation using its authentication token, 
and then return the result of this operation to the service. The service may validate the result or send it to the Domain 
Controller (DC) for validation. If the service or DC confirm that the clientâ€™s response is correct, the service allows 
access to the client.
