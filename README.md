   - Downloading database for the first time:
   
     To download our database, go to starsflaw/db/install_BDD.php and execute this page.
     If it is not working, you need to modify the file install_BDD.php the user at line 5 or change the database name at line 7 and 18.

## Prerequisites

   You can access to all the prerequisites in the website after sign in.
   
   The prerequisites are necessary for completing the first 4 CTF challenges.

   - **Docker Desktop & Docker Hub**

        Docker Desktop is a Mac or Windows environment that enables you tobuild and share containerized applications and microservices.
   
        We will use it to launch the other 4 challenges.
 
     - Docker Desktop

       To install Docker desktop, go to [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) 
       to download it.

        You will need to download WSL 2 if you are running Docker Desktop on Windows.

     - WSL installation:

       To install WSL 2, run __*wsl --install*__ on your PowerShell as administrator. 
       
       Then, go to [https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/install-manual](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/install-manual) 
       and follow the first 5 steps.
       
      You can now pull containers from Docker Hub.

## About us

We are students in fourth year of engineering school, majoring in Cybersecurity at ESME Sudria.

As a student and future cybersecurity engineer, we wanted to learn the basics of how to secure an IT infrastructure.

Information systems are regularly attacked by "pirates" or "hackers ill-intentioned ‚Äù, for various reasons (economic, political, etc.). To overcome these cyber attacks, IT infrastructures must be tested through penetration tests to ensure the right level of security.

We then chose this project to learn how to conduct a test first. intrusion, the various attack methods and the corrective measures to apply. Then in the second step, we wanted to transmit our knowledge through a platform mixing courses and challenges in order to provide a fun education on the Security of information systems.

This is why we created Star's Flaw: to bring concepts of Pentesting and Cybersecurity more generally, for those who are interested.
